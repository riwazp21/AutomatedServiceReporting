CS 234 Final Project

The database has 3 tables
1. Registration 2. Organization 3. Service

The first page to show up on the website is the login page
The user can either create an account or login to the main site through this page.

The admin can fetch, update, delete, and insert a record. The admin's username is admin and password is admin.

There is a one-to-many relationship among tables. The service table takes the student id and organization id from registration and organization table to insert new records of service hours for students.

The user homepage shows the history of service hours and details that the user has done so far. 

Session is used to make sure that a user can only access the login page until and unless they login with the correct credential.

Regex is used to validate the password in the createAccount page so that it has at least one digit. It is also used in Insert Record for the admin privilege so that users can only enter a digit value for year and hours.

Password is also hashed.
